# OpenPLC Mini Water Treatment Testbed

The MiniWater, a smaller representation of the SWaT system, includes the
first two to three processes of the
[SWaT](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/itrust-labs_swat/).
To provide a cost-effective and open-source alternative to industrial
PLCs, MiniWater integrates Raspberry Pi 4s using OpenPLC. This approach
allows for a low cost mimic of Operation Technology (OT) components such
as PLCs, and information Technology (IT) components, such as the OpenPLC
Runtime Server.

# **Software**

## [OpenPLC]{.underline}

-   OpenPLC is an open-source software that simulates PLC. It allows the
    creation of automation programs in Industrial Control Systems by
    using microcontrollers or single board computers (SBC) as PLCs.

-   [[OpenPLC documentation for installation and
    overview]{.underline}](https://autonomylogic.com/docs/openplc-overview/)

#### PSM (Python Submodule)

-   OpenPLC's PSM serves as a bridge between the PLC's core logic and
    the physical world, providing low-level access to inputs and
    outputs. It operates as a real-time (best effort) hardware driver to
    provide accurate I/O data to the PLC's logic. The PSM has no
    visibility to the PLC logic and only sees the I/Os.

##### Features:

-   Provides simple direct I/O access function like psm.set_var and
    psm.get_var

-   You can tag/label any variable you want...

##### 

##### Best Practices:

-   **Keep PSM Code Simple:** Focus on effiecent I/O access and avoid
    complex calculations or time-consuming operations

    -   PSM runtime core's scan cycle of 20ms limit

-   **Consider External Libraries:** For advanced hardware interactions
    (e.g. RGB sensor) or data processing (e.g. calculating distance),
    explore using external Python libraries within the PSM.


## Instructions for setting up water treatment simulator (Digital Twin)
1.  Setup OpenPLC Runtime on any local device (could be a Linux VM, Windows, etc.)
    a.  Follow the instructions here depending on what target OS you are using:  https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3
2.  Once your PLC runtime is running, go to the webserver (should be just http://<ipaddress>:8080
    a.  Where <ipaddress> is replaced with the IP address of your runtime 
    b.  Login with “openplc” for both username and password
3.  Go to the “Programs” tab in the Dashboard
    a.  Unzip the files from plc2sim.zip and look for the “generated_plc2.st” file
    b.  Upload the program and name it whatever you’d like
    c.  On the bottom left, click “Start PLC”
4.  Observe the monitoring values in “Monitoring” tab
5.  Run the simulator script to generate values for your PLC
6.  You should be able to modify the trace generation scripts for the simulator
